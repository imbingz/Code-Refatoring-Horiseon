### What I have learned
  1. Keep the code clean and structure design simple, bearing the questions: " Will the future me understand the intention of this block of codes?" 
  1.  Think about the problems and how will I solve them by writing pseudo-codes first before I start to code. 
  1. Think about broader audience, especially people who might need external tools to help them use/read the websites. Reading through ARIA documentation and watching chrome development videos have opened my eyes on how people with different disabilities need web developers to help them access the info as I do. 
  1. Think about SEO. A beautifully and functionally designed website is certainly important; however, it is no use if people cannot find it through search. A little changes on my code such as the title and meta tags can make big different for clients. 
  1. Think on behalf of clients. Sometimes, clients may not have the knowledge and awareness regarding the best practice for, say, accessibilities, SEO and coding. It is my job to make sure to delivery the clients solutions with long-term sustainability in mind. 
  1. The last but not least is to pay extra attention to details. A typo or even a comma may break the functionalities of the codes.
